WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT YOU WERE SOLVING IN THE PROJECTS FOR THIS COURSE?

The program that we were solving was a Course Planner for students to use to view all course and indepent course. Another thing that we were asked to solve 

was to make sure that when the code printed that it was in alphanumeric. We used a structure, in this case a hash table, to search, sort and print the information

from the csv or txt file that was given to us.

HOW DID YOU APPROACH THE PROBLEM? CONSIDER WHY DATA STRUCTURES ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND.

I approached the problem by first starting with a binary search tree. I then changed my approach to be a hash table as this would be the data stuture that would 

fit more as a stuture for what we needed to do. Data strutures are important because with all the ones that we learned in this course the all function in different ways.

If you do not have the right fit for what you are trying to do then you will not end up with the results that you want. It would be like fiting a sqaure block into a

circle hole. You may get one side to fit but the whole thing will not. This is why it is important to pick the one that we would need for our program.

HOW DID YOU OVERCOME ANY ROADBLOCKS THAT YOU ENCOUNTERED WHILE GOING THROUGH THE ACTIVTIES OR PROJECT?

The one issue that I had was how the schedule printed out. I spent hours on how to fix this. I got the parser to read the csv file and I showed this by printing out

the courses when the file would load in the csv. However, this issue that I had in my could laid with the insert file. This was the one function that gave me the most trouble.

The values that the key was being given if we were to keep it the same would stay 0. So I tried to come up with a way that the values were not double nor set to 0

so the program could read them. I ran out of time but continue to play with the code to get it perfect.

HOW HAS YOUR WORK ON THIS PROJECT EXPANDED YOUR APPROACH TO DESIGNING SOFTWARE AND DEVELOPING PROGRAMS?

My work on this project has expanded my approach by knowing how to debug. This was a very important task for me to know. The data strutures are evry important and I think

sitting down and knowing how you approach the program and what you will need. However, sometime in a project you can take one step forward and two steps backwards.

For me that happened when I went to debugging and sitting down and learning new was to go about that was something that I will take with me everywhere when making new programs.

HOW HAS YOUR WORK ON THIS PROJECT EVOLVED THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAINTAINABLE, READABLE AND ADAPTABLE?

Once again this rolls back around to the problem that I had. This taught me that sometime things break and don't work. The code that I wrote can adapte to what I need it

to do. One thing that I was always taught was to stay away from spaghetti code so to speak. Making sure that it is clean and that you can change what you need to without

breaking eighty things in the process. This class had me sit and thing to make sure that the code that I was write or changing was not like this and maintainable.
